Welcome to the DinoDNS docs homepage!
<!-- truncate -->
These docs are meant to provide a place for a high-level overview of how to use DinoDNS and why we built it. This blog will serve as a spot for community updates, highlights on development, and other cool things we're doing with DinoDNS!

We hope to be bringing a lot more to the table in terms of documentation, development, benchmarking, and providing some real-world use cases for DinoDNS in the wild!

Until then, ðŸ‘‹
