Networks are the interfaces that handle serialization and deserialization between the underlying network protocols, and create servers for their respective protocols.

The only packaged networks that are included in DinoDNS are `DNSOverTCP` and `DNSOverUDP`. However, there is also a `DNSOverHTTP` plugin that can be installed which supports HTTP/S.
